# KonohoDB
KonohaDB is a hybrid database system that seamlessly blends the structured data management capabilities of SQL databases with the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL databases. This innovative approach empowers developers to build robust and efficient transactional systems that can handle complex data models and high-throughput workloads. By combining the best of both worlds, KonohaDB offers a comprehensive solution for a wide range of applications, from traditional enterprise systems to modern, data-driven services.

With KonohaDB, developers can leverage:

* ACID-compliant transactions for data integrity
* Flexible schema design for rapid development and scaling
* Optimized query performance across structured and semi-structured data

There are some guidelines we propose to implement KonohaDB

* The NoSQL acts as the central ledger that only recieves INSERT requests.
* The user can setup as many SQL table as they need, to act as the readable source of data, meaning they only recieve GET requests.
* Every INSERT request will also SAVE or UPDATE the SQL table
* So the users will only ever INSERT into the NoSQL ledger, which will update the relevant SQL tables, and the users will only ever GET from the SQL tables

Our latest implementation demonstrates its prowess in a social media-style website where users can interact with posts. Here's how KonohaDB shines in this scenario:

## Example Implementation: Social Media Website
In our example social media website, KonohaDB efficiently handles user interactions with posts:

### Data Storage:
Posts are stored in SQL tables for structured data and relationships.
User actions (likes/dislikes) are stored in NoSQL documents as a transaction ledger.
### Real-time Updates:
When a user performs an action (like or dislike), the application sends a request to KonohaDB.
The NoSQL database immediately stores the action.
Simultaneously, the SQL table is updated with aggregated results for the specific post.
### Efficient Retrieval:
When displaying a post, the application queries the SQL table for current likes and dislikes.
This approach leverages SQL's strengths in handling complex queries and maintaining referential integrity.
### Scalability:
The hybrid approach allows for easy scaling. NoSQL handles high-volume writes, while SQL optimizes read-heavy operations.
### Flexibility:
Users can easily add new interaction types without schema changes in the NoSQL portion.
Complex aggregations and analytics can be performed efficiently using SQL.


By combining the strengths of both SQL and NoSQL databases, KonohaDB provides a powerful solution for web applications requiring transactional functionalities, scalability, and flexible data models. 

We appreciate your patience as we are working to add more soon...
